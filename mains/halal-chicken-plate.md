## Instructions

### Make Rice

6. **Pearl rice:** Add rice, stir to coat with spices. Toast 2-3 minutes.

7. **Add liquid:** Pour in chicken stock and add bay leaf. Bring to boil.

8. **Cook covered:** Once boiling, reduce to low. Cover with towel-wrapped lid. Cook 18 minutes.

## Notes
- The mayo in the marinade is key - it adheres better than oil and creates incredible char
